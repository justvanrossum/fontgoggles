<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>Agyei Archer: <em>“🤩🤩🤩”</em></p>
<p>Stephen Nixon: <em>“Super nice! I really love how this lets me compare the same
variable axes across multiple fonts. It’s super interesting to visually
compare how different fonts handle wght, opsz, etc. I also love that I can
put this in my mac dock and drag font files directly onto it, rather than
booting up a browser to test things. And the light/dark modes are right on
point.”</em></p>
<p>Thomas Thiemich: <em>“The most impressive feature of this tool so far is its
speed — it’s quite impressive how fast it handles multiple fonts or variable
fonts.”</em></p>
<p>Ben Mitchell: <em>“I especially like the ability to scale text within the samples
and adjust the baseline, wish other apps were this intuitive.”</em></p>
<p>Petr van Blokland: <em>“FontGoggles works really well. Truly live feature
source code debugging for many masters simultaneously. Awesome.”</em></p>
<p>Paul van der Laan (Bold Monday): <em>“Really impressive! Love the uncluttered
interface. Support for UFO files is fantastic. Being able to instantly
preview a variable font by dropping a designspace file is a BIG help.”</em></p>
<p>Arthur Reinders Folmer (Typearture): <em>“These goggles need no prescription!
FontGoggles shows and compares complex color and variable fonts fast and
fluid, making refinements and adjustments a piece of cake. An amazing
variable color font proofing app for all file formats.”</em></p>
<p>Stephen Nixon, two days later: <em>“WOW. Font Goggles is just so good. It allows
me to open a preview of the full Recursive designspace in maybe 4 or 5
seconds. Way quicker than any other way of checking whether a given
interpolation will work as desired.”</em></p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Drop some fonts (or folders with fonts) onto the application, or launch
the application, and drop some fonts onto the window.</p>
<p>A new, empty window looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_2_empty.png" /></p>
<p>After dropping some fonts it will look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_3_filled.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom in/out by using pinch gestures on your trackpad, or use ⌘-plus
  and ⌘-minus, or option-scroll.</li>
<li>Type text in the text field to change the displayed text</li>
<li>Drag and drop can be used to rearrange the fonts</li>
<li>Click on a font to see the glyph positioning information</li>
<li>Select glyphs by clicking on them, which will highlight glyph
  positioning info and character info</li>
<li>In the font list, use arrow keys to navigate glyphs and fonts</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Character and Glyph lists</h2>
<p>On the left hand side of the FontGoggles window there are two lists.</p>
<p>The left-most one is the <em>Character list</em>, which shows the entered
characters and their Unicode values.</p>
<p>Characters are listed in logical order (first-to-last, in the
natural writing direction of the script).</p>
<p>The second list is the <em>Glyph list</em>, which can show information about
the rendered glyphs, such as their names, advance values and positioning.
Since this information is font-specific, it only shows information when
exactly one font is selected (or when only one font has been opened).</p>
<p>The glyphs in the <em>Glyph list</em> are ordered from left to right in <em>visual</em>
order, or from top to bottom in vertical mode.</p>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_4_arabic.png" /></p>
<p>Selecting items in the <em>Character list</em> will reflect the selection in the
<em>Glyphs list</em> and vice versa. A single glyph can belong to multiple
characters (for example in the case of ligatures), or vice versa.</p>
<p>Characters and glyphs are “clustered” by the shaping engine (HarfBuzz),
and the <em>Glyph list</em> contains a column named “cluster” that shows the
cluster number for each glyph. For more in-depth information see the
<a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">HarfBuzz documentation</a>.
Selecting a character or glyph in one list will select the entire cluster
in the other list.</p>
<p>Both lists can be scrolled horizontally or resized to reveal more information,
and columns can be rearranged by dragging them around.</p>
<p>You can copy information from both <em>Character</em> and <em>Glyph lists</em> by selecting
rows or columns and hit ⌘-C. Select multiple rows or columns by holding
the Command key while clicking further items. For example, click on the
“glyph” header in the <em>Glyph list</em> to select the glyph name column, the hit
⌘-C to copy the sequence of glyph names to the clipboard. If multiple columns
are involved in the selection, the clipboard data will be tab-separated, ready
to be pasted into a spreadsheet.</p>
<h2>The Font list</h2>
<p>The <em>Font list</em> is the central section of the FontGoggles window. Font files can be
dropped here, fonts can be selected, rearranged by dragging them around,
or removed from the list with the delete key.</p>
<p>You can control-click on a font to get a contextual menu. The menu item
there is to reveal the font in the Finder.</p>
<p>Fonts can also be dragged to other applications, which is equivalent to
dragging them from the finder. You can also drag and drop fonts between
FontGoggles windows.</p>
<h2>Text settings</h2>
<p>At the top right of the FontGoggles window you find four buttons with
popup menus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direction/orientation</li>
<li>Visual alignment</li>
<li>Script</li>
<li>Language</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Direction/orientation</em> menu has six options:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Automatic, with BiDi and Segmentation</em>: apply the Unicode bidirectional
  algorithm, which will determine the dominant writing direction, as well
  as perform segmentation of the string based on runs with the same script
  and the same BiDi level.</li>
<li><em>Automatic, w/o BiDi and Segmentation</em>: let HarfBuzz guess the writing
  direction and the script of the text, do not applying the Unicode
  bidirectional algorithm, and do not perform segmentation.</li>
<li><em>Left-to-Right</em>: force the direction of the text to be Left-to-Right</li>
<li><em>Right-to-Left</em>: force the direction of the text to be Right-to-Left</li>
<li><em>Top-to-Bottom</em>: use vertical layout, Top-to-Bottom</li>
<li><em>Bottom-to-Top</em>: use vertical layout, Bottom-to-Top</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Visual alignment</em> button controls how the rendered text is visually
aligned within the window. Its menu has four options:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Automatic</em>: Use the alignment that is most natural with the detected
  writing direction</li>
<li><em>Left</em>: align left</li>
<li><em>Right</em>: align right</li>
<li><em>Center</em>: align center</li>
</ul>
<p>In vertical mode, the options are <em>Automatic</em>, <em>Top</em>, <em>Bottom</em> and <em>Center</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_5_cjk.png" /></p>
<p>The <em>Script</em> button overrides the automatic detection of the script by
HarfBuzz.</p>
<p>The <em>Language</em> button allows you to specify for which language any
language-specific lookups will be activated.</p>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_6_turkish.png" /></p>
<h2>Formatting settings</h2>
<p>The <em>Features</em> panel shows the superset of GSUB and GPOS features of
all opened fonts. You can click feature tags to enable them (green),
disable them (red) or use their default setting (gray). Clicking the
tags cycles through the modes (gray → green → red → gray). Holding the
option key reverses the cycling direction (gray → red → green → gray).</p>
<p>For <code>GSUB</code> features, you can control-click (right-click) on a feature
tag to get a contextual menu, allowing you to specify an alternate
number for features that expose alternate glyphs, such as <code>aalt</code>.</p>
<p>The <em>Variations</em> panel shows sliders for all axes defined in the opened
fonts. The minimum and maximum values for an axis are the lowest and
highest values found in all opened fonts that have that axis.</p>
<p>When multiple variable fonts (and/or .designspace files) are opened,
all axes in all open fonts are set to their respective default values.
However, since this value can be different per font, the slider will
in that case show an arbitrary position, and the numeric field will
be empty as a sign there is not a single possible value.</p>
<p>The <em>Options</em> panel has three sliders and a checkbox that affect the
display of the text:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Relative Size</em> slider controls the relative size of the text in
  comparison to the box in which is is displayed. A value of 100 scales
  the Units Per Em value to the display box size.</li>
<li>The <em>Baseline</em> slider controls the baseline position, as a percentage
  of the display box size.</li>
<li>The <em>Margin</em> slider controls the left and right margins, as a percentage
  of the display box size. Or top and bottom in vertical layout mode.</li>
<li>The <em>Enable Color (COLR/CPAL)</em> checkbox allows you to choose whether
  color glyphs are displayed if available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customize the window layout</h2>
<p>Most panels in the window are resizable, and some are collapsable.
There are also “View” menu items to show and hide the collapsable
panels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show/hide Character list — ⌘-1</li>
<li>Show/hide Glyph list — ⌘-2</li>
<li>Show/hide Compile output — ⌘-3</li>
<li>Show/hide Formatting options — ⌘-4</li>
</ul>
<p>With another “View” menu item you can hide or show the font file name labels
in the Font list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show/hide Font File name — ⌘-5</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_7_hindi.png" /></p>
<h2>Load and navigate a text file</h2>
<p>Instead of typing the text into the text field, you may load an external
text file, using the “Load Text File...” menu under “View”, or with the
“gear” popup menu next to the text field.</p>
<p>Once loaded, you can navigate through the lines of the text file with
the “stepper” control next to the text field. The “View” menu has shortcuts
for this: ⌘-arrow-key-up and ⌘-arrow-key-down to go to the previous or next
line respectively.</p>
<p>You can keep editing the text file in a text editor while it is loaded in
FontGoggles: it will reload the text file and show the changes.</p>
<h2>Save a project file</h2>
<p>You can save a window as a <code>.gggls</code> project file. Apart from the viewed
fonts, it will store all text, formatting and window settings.</p>
<p><em>Note: The file stores relative paths to the font files, so its location
is related on the location of the font files. They can move together,
but if sources move or the project file moves, the source references in
the project file become invalid.</em></p>
<h2>Edit a font with another application</h2>
<p>If a font gets changed on-disk by another application, FontGoggles will
reload it and show the updated version. For example, this happens, when
you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-generate a .ttf or .otf from a font editor.</li>
<li>Edit a .ufo with a font editor</li>
<li>Edit a .ufo with a text editor</li>
<li>Edit a .designspace file</li>
<li>Edit a .fea file associated with a .ufo or .designspace file</li>
<li>Edit a .ttx file</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: FontGoggles does its very best to reload as quickly as possible,
but for .ufo and .designspace it may have to re-compile OpenType
features, and the time needed depends on the complexity of the font.</em></p>
<h2>Compile warnings and errors</h2>
<p>When an error or warning occurs during the loading of a font, the
font list will show that by highlighting the font with a diagonally
striped background. To view the error details, click on the font, and
the compile output panel at the bottom of the font list will appear.</p>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_7_error.png" /></p>
<h2>Unicode Picker</h2>
<p>FontGoggles provides its own Unicode Picker, under the “Edit” menu:
“Unicode Picker”, shortcut ⌘-U. It allows you to find a Unicode
character by name.</p>
<p>You can use multiple search terms: each additional term will narrow
down the result. It searches by prefix, so you can for example type
“ara let” to find Arabic letters.</p>
<p>Double click a character from the results to insert it in the front-most
FontGoggles window. Alternatively you can copy selected character from
the results list with the “Copy” button, or by typing ⌘-C.</p>
<p><img alt="FontGoggles screenshot" src="images/screenshot_8_color_unicode.png" /></p>
<p>Instead of searching by Unicode name, you can enter a Unicode hex
value, such as <code>1F63B</code> or with a <code>U+</code>, <code>0x</code>, <code>u</code> or <code>uni</code> prefix.
These are examples of valid Unicode literal search terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>1F63B</code></li>
<li><code>U+1F63B</code></li>
<li><code>0x1F63B</code></li>
<li><code>u1F63B</code></li>
<li><code>uni1234</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Q: Can glyph names be used as text input?</li>
<li><em>A: No. FontGoggles uses HarfBuzz for text shaping, and for it to do
  its work correctly, the input has to be Unicode text. For example, to
  do correct shaping for the Arabic script, Unicode character attributes
  are needed, which are not available from glyph name input.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>HarfBuzz is used for text shaping, not CoreText</li>
<li>Hints are not taken into account: glyph rasterisation is done by the
  OS from unhinted outlines</li>
<li>Source formats are partially compiled, using parts of the <code>fontmake</code>
  toolchain, therefore source previews match binary fonts as built with
  <code>fontmake</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>macOS 10.13 and higher</li>
</ul>
